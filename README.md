# CCSF-CS110A
This repository contains my solutions to CS 110A as taken at CCSF with Professor Aaron Brick during the Fall 2014 semester.

I hope that this will serve as ample inspiration for your own code, but do not hold me liable for any problems from copying my assignments!

##### HW1: Sentence

Write a program which prints out a sentence of your choice.

##### HW2: Convert

Write a function that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and, given that water freezes and boils at 0 and 100 degrees Celsius, use it to derive those temperatures in Fahrenheit.

##### HW3: Invest

Write a program that calculates and prints the final value of a ten year, $10,000 investment whose annual return gradually declines from 2% to 1% over that term.

##### HW4: X

Define a string containing a sentence about Xerox and/or Exxon (you write it). Print out the sentence along with percentages of its length in characters being the letter X in upper and lower case (e.g., the result might be 4.7619% for X, 14.2857% for x).

##### HW5: Random

Write a program that picks and prints out one random word from the dictionary /users/abrick/resources/american-english-insane . Assume that the file has a constant 650722 lines in it. Each of those outcomes should be equally likely.

##### HW6: Stem

This program reads a file to build a dictionary where each line saves one word. Based on the stem given in the command line argument, this program will look for the words in the dictionary with the same prefix as the stem, and print out all matching words.

##### Extra Credit: Spelling Game

Based on the random homework, this program omits two random letters from a randomly selected word and tests your spelling on the word.
